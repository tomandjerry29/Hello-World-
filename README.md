# Hello-World-
Just another repository 
I'm a college student at Valencia college and is interested in learning software development skills. My first plan for college was to go into pre-med and then become a physician assisting but once taking irrelevent classes. I just started to shift into the IT field and take up a new skill and career. Surprisingly, I enjoy learning codes. I think it's intriguing to make the computer do whatever you want to do. I'm huge fan of sports cars and interacting with other that have the same interest.
